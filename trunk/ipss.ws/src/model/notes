Notes for InterPSS Workspace model

1) A doc is always associated with a WsItem (ProjectItem or Project). However, 
   a WsItem may or may not be associated with a doc. For example, ProjectItemGroup
   ProjectFolder, Workspace are WsItem, but have not an associated document
   
               WsItem <-(1)--(0-1)-> Doc
   
   WsItem and Document are two aspects or views of an InterPSS object
   
   WsItem - used to store "physical" attributes, such as filename, open/close status,
            parent folder
            
            WsFileItem - For describing a file item
            
            WsDbItem - For describing a Db Record
            
   IpssDocument - used to store "logical" attributes, such as file type, dirty indicator           
   
   
2) Workspace structure in Project Explorer

    Workspace
       |
       |- ProjectFolder
               |
               |- Project (IpssSimuDocument)
                     |
                     |- ProjectItemGroup
                     |      |
                     |      |- ProjectItem (IpssReportDocument)
                     |- ProjectItem(IpssTextDocument)
                     |           
                     
3) By default we create (Reports, Scripts, Notes, DBRecords) ProjectItemGroup under
   any new project. User should be able to add a new ItemGroup under a project
