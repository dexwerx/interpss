- Modifications made to report implemementation. More implmentation is needed at your side

The following are my suggestions

1) User normally click Report->Default Report to display the default report for the current document and
   the current run. Display the report and auto save the report under the project. Also, we need to detect
   if there is the report for the project already open. If there is, replace the report.
   
2) User can also click other report memuitem under the Report. Display the report and marked with dirty. When user 
   logout, ask if want to Save or SaveAs
   
3) User can open any existing report.

4) User also can export a report to other formats     

Please see my implementation at EditorActionAdapter.java. Also please see my notes.

To test the currently implementation

load IEEE-14Bus.ipss case
Click the LF button
Click the Report button, you shold see a report display and added 
Click Report->AC Loadflow->Summary, you should see a report diaplay, but not added

There are still issues. I would like to let see my implementation, so that we can in synch
