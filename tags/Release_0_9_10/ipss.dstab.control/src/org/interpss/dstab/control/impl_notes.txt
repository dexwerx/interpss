Steps to implement a controller model
- create a new package, such as com.interpss.dstab.control.exc.dc1a
- copy all files from an existing model to the new package and use refactor to change name
- modify <*>ExcitorData fields for the new model
- implement dynamic simulation methods in the <*>Excitor
- use a Swing GUI editor, such as NetBeans, modify the GUI Panel
- add the model to the ControllerRegister.java
- write JUnit test case - Test<*>ExcitorCase.java
