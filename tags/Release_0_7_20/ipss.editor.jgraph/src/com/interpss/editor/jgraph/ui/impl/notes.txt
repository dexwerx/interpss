This is a sample implmentation of the JGraph UI interfaces. In it, there are three "dummy" 
editor dialog boxes: DummyProjectEditDialog, DummyBusEditDialog and DummyBranchEditDialog.
Data are stored in the Dummy*Form. 

This package serve two purposes:

1) Testing code for graphic development. With this setup, the graphic code development
team do not have to know anything about power system simulation code.

2) Starting point for new simulation system development.
